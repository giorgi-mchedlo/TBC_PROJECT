#########JAVASCRIPT#########

# JavaScript Files Overview

## Acordion.js

The `acordion.js` file contains JavaScript code for an accordion-style FAQ section. It toggles the active class on the clicked question, allowing users to expand or collapse answers. The script ensures that only one question can be active at a time.

## Script.js

The `script.js` file handles the functionality of a responsive menu. It toggles the appearance of the navigation menu on button click (`#menu-btn`). Additionally, it closes the menu when the user scrolls, providing a smooth user experience.

## Slider.js

The `slider.js` file is responsible for implementing a simple image slider or carousel. It allows users to navigate through a set of slides using previous and next buttons. The slider automatically updates its position to display the current slide.

## Usage

Feel free to integrate these JavaScript files into your web project. They provide interactive features such as a dynamic FAQ section, responsive navigation, and a customizable image slider. Make sure to link these scripts appropriately in your HTML file.
